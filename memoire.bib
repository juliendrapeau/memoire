  abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be ``reduced'' to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here ``reduced'' means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

  abstract = {The k-SAT problem is to determine if a given k-CNF has a satisfying assignment. It is a celebrated open question as to whether it requires exponential time to solve k-SAT for k⩾3. Here exponential time means 2{$\delta$}n for some {$\delta>$}0. In this paper, assuming that, for k⩾3, k-SAT requires exponential time complexity, we show that the complexity of k-SAT increases as k increases. More precisely, for k⩾3, define sk=inf\{{$\delta$}:there exists 2{$\delta$}n algorithm for solving k-SAT\}. Define ETH (Exponential-Time Hypothesis) for k-SAT as follows: for k⩾3, sk{$>$}0. In this paper, we show that sk is increasing infinitely often assuming ETH for k-SAT. Let s{$\infty$} be the limit of sk. We will in fact show that sk{$\leq$}(1-d/k)s{$\infty$} for some constant d{$>$}0. We prove this result by bringing together the ideas of critical clauses and the Sparsification Lemma to reduce the satisfiability of a k-CNF to the satisfiability of a disjunction of 2{$\varepsilon$}nk{$\prime$}-CNFs in fewer variables for some k{$\prime$}⩾k and arbitrarily small {$\varepsilon>$}0. We also show that such a disjunction can be computed in time 2{$\varepsilon$}n for arbitrarily small {$\varepsilon>$}0.},
