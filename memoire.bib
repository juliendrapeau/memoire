  abstract = {We give new evidence that quantum computers -- moreover, rudimentary quantum computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be efficiently simulated by classical computers. In particular, we define a model of computation in which identical photons are generated, sent through a linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P\#P=BPPNP, and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately, this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation.Our main result suggests that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven conjectures: the Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture, which says that it is \#P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1) Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the Permanent Anti-Concentration Conjecture, which says that |Per(A)|\&gt;=√(n!)poly(n) with high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of which seem interesting even apart from our application.This paper does not assume knowledge of quantum optics. Indeed, part of its goal is to develop the beautiful theory of noninteracting bosons underlying our model, and its connection to the permanent function, in a self-contained way accessible to theoretical computer scientists.},

In this review we give an account of most of the major theoretical developments in the field, while focusing on the closed-system setting. The review is organized around a series of topics that are essential to an understanding of the underlying principles of AQC, its algorithmic accomplishments and limitations, and its scope in the more general setting of computational complexity theory. We present several variants of the adiabatic theorem, the cornerstone of AQC, and we give examples of explicit AQC algorithms that exhibit a quantum speedup. We give an overview of several proofs of the universality of AQC and related Hamiltonian quantum complexity theory. We finally devote considerable space to Stoquastic AQC, the setting of most AQC work to date, where we discuss obstructions to success and their possible resolutions.},

  abstract = {Understanding NP-complete problems is a central topic in computer science (NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time). This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer’s Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

  abstract = {One of the most important properties of classical neural networks is how surprisingly trainable they are, though their training algorithms typically rely on optimizing complicated, nonconvex loss functions. Previous results have shown that unlike the case in classical neural networks, variational quantum models are often not trainable. The most studied phenomenon is the onset of barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically when the models are very deep. This focus on barren plateaus has made the phenomenon almost synonymous with the trainability of quantum models. Here, we show that barren plateaus are only a part of the story. We prove that a wide class of variational quantum models—which are shallow, and exhibit no barren plateaus—have only a superpolynomially small fraction of local minima within any constant energy from the global minimum, rendering these models untrainable if no good initial guess of the optimal parameters is known. We also study the trainability of variational quantum algorithms from a statistical query framework, and show that noisy optimization of a wide variety of quantum models is impossible with a sub-exponential number of queries. Finally, we numerically confirm our results on a variety of problem instances. Though we exclude a wide variety of quantum algorithms here, we give reason for optimism for certain classes of variational algorithms and discuss potential ways forward in showing the practical utility of such algorithms.},

  abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly employed in safety-critical domains. This has prompted interest in verifying or certifying logically encoded properties of neural networks. Prior work has largely focused on checking existential properties, wherein the goal is to check whether there exists any input that violates a given property of interest. However, neural network training is a stochastic process, and many questions arising in their analysis require probabilistic and quantitative reasoning, i.e., estimating how many inputs satisfy a given property. To this end, our paper proposes a novel and principled framework to quantitative verification of logical properties specified over neural networks. Our framework is the first to provide PAC-style soundness guarantees, in that its quantitative estimates are within a controllable and bounded error from the true count. We instantiate our algorithmic framework by building a prototype tool called NPAQ that enables checking rich properties over binarized neural networks. We show how emerging security analyses can utilize our framework in 3 applications: quantifying robustness to adversarial inputs, efficacy of trojan attacks, and fairness/bias of given neural networks.},

We illustrate the potential of GM-QAOA on several optimization problem classes: for permutation-based optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem, we present an efficient algorithm to prepare a superposition of all possible permutations of \$n\$ numbers, defined on O (n 2) qubits; for the hard constraint k-Vertex-Cover problem, and for an application to Discrete Portfolio Rebalancing, we show that GM-QAOA outperforms existing QAOA approaches.},

My personal interest in SAT stems from actual solving: The increase in power of modern SAT solvers over the past 15 years has been phenomenal. It has become the key enabling technology in automated verification of both computer hardware and software. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) of computer hardware is now probably the most widely used model checking technique. The counterexamples that it finds are just satisfying instances of a Boolean formula obtained by unwinding to some fixed depth a sequential circuit and its specification in linear temporal logic. Extending model checking to software verification is a much more difficult problem on the frontier of current research. One promising approach for languages like C with finite word-length integers is to use the same idea as in BMC but with a decision procedure for the theory of bit-vectors instead of SAT. All decision procedures for bit-vectors that I am familiar with ultimately make use of a fast SAT solver to handle complex formulas. Decision procedures for more complicated theories, like linear real and integer arithmetic, are also used in program verification. Most of them use powerful SAT solvers in an essential way. Clearly, efficient SAT solving is a key technology for 21st century computer science. I expect this collection of papers on all theoretical and practical aspects of SAT solving will be extremely useful to both students and researchers and will lead to many further advances in the field.'

Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum approximate optimization algorithms that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea of using a classical computer to train a parametrized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that, for every polynomial time algorithm, there are instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large assuming that P≠NP. Even for classically tractable systems composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show the optimization to be NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima This means gradient and higher order descent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.},

This comprehensive review offers an overview of the current state of QAOA, encompassing its performance analysis in diverse scenarios, its applicability across various problem instances, and considerations of hardware-specific challenges such as error susceptibility and noise resilience. Additionally, we conduct a comparative study of selected QAOA extensions and variants, while exploring future prospects and directions for the algorithm. We aim to provide insights into key questions about the algorithm, such as whether it can outperform classical algorithms and under what circumstances it should be used.

  abstract = {A critical milestone on the path to useful quantum computers is the demonstration of a quantum computation that is prohibitively hard for classical computers—a task referred to as quantum supremacy. A leading near-term candidate is sampling from the probability distributions of randomly chosen quantum circuits, which we call random circuit sampling (RCS). RCS was defined with experimental realizations in mind, leaving its computational hardness unproven. Here we give strong complexity-theoretic evidence of classical hardness of RCS, placing it on par with the best theoretical proposals for supremacy. Specifically, we show that RCS satisfies an average-case hardness condition, which is critical to establishing computational hardness in the presence of experimental noise. In addition, it follows from known results that RCS also satisfies an anti-concentration property, namely that errors in estimating output probabilities are small with respect to the probabilities themselves. This makes RCS the first proposal for quantum supremacy with both of these properties. Finally, we also give a natural condition under which an existing statistical measure, cross-entropy, verifies RCS, as well as describe a new verification measure that in some formal sense maximizes the information gained from experimental samples.},

In particular, we cover: introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information, basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz states. The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information.

  abstract = {Guided by the premise that solving some of the world's most important mathematical problems will advance the field, this book offers a fascinating look at the seven unsolved Millennium Prize problems. This work takes the unprecedented approach of describing these important and difficult problems at the professional level. In announcing the seven problems and a US\$7 million prize fund in 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute emphasized that mathematics still constitutes an openfrontier with important unsolved problems. The descriptions in this book serve the Institute's mission to ``further the beauty, power and universality of mathematical thinking.'' Separate chapters are devoted to each of the seven problems: the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, the Hodge Conjecture, theNavier-Stokes Equation, the P versus NP Problem, the Poincare Conjecture, the Riemann Hypothesis, and Quantum Yang-Mills Theory. An essay by Jeremy Gray, a well-known expert in the history of mathematics, outlines the history of prize problems in mathematics and shows how some of mathematics' most important discoveries were first revealed in papers submitted for prizes. Numerous photographs of mathematicians who shaped mathematics as it is known today give the text a broad historical appeal.Anyone interested in mathematicians' continued efforts to solve important problems will be fascinated with this text, which places into context the historical dimension of important achievements.

Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

  abstract = {Functional verification constitutes one of the most challenging tasks in the development of modern hardware systems, and simulation-based verification techniques dominate the functional verification landscape. A dominant paradigm in simulation-based verification is directed random testing, where a model of the system is simulated with a set of random test stimuli that are uniformly or near-uniformly distributed over the space of all stimuli satisfying a given set of constraints. Uniform or near-uniform generation of solutions for large constraint sets is therefore a problem of theoretical and practical interest. For Boolean constraints, prior work offered heuristic approaches with no guarantee of performance, and theoretical approaches with proven guarantees, but poor performance in practice. We offer here a new approach with theoretical performance guarantees and demonstrate its practical utility on large constraint sets.},

From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second.

A promising new algebraic approach to constrained counting makes use of tensor networks, following a reduction from constrained counting to the problem of tensor-network contraction. Contracting a tensor network efficiently requires determining an efficient order to contract the tensors inside the network, which is itself a difficult problem. In this work, we apply graph decompositions to find contraction orders for tensor networks. We prove that finding an efficient contraction order for a tensor network is equivalent to the well-known problem of finding an optimal carving decomposition. Thus memory-optimal contraction orders for planar tensor networks can be found in cubic time. We show that tree decompositions can be used both to find carving decompositions and to factor tensor networks with high-rank, structured tensors. We implement these algorithms on top of state-of-the-art solvers for tree decompositions and show empirically that the resulting weighted model counter is quite effective and useful as part of a portfolio of counters.},

Consequently, there has been surge of interest in the problem of quantification of system reliability, which is known to be \#P-complete. Reliability also contributes to the resilience of systems, so as to effectively make them bounce back after contingencies. Despite diverse progress, most techniques to estimate system reliability and resilience remain computationally expensive. In this paper, we investigate how recent advances in hashing-based approaches to counting can be exploited to improve computational techniques for system reliability.The primary contribution of this paper is a novel framework, RelNet, that reduces the problem of computing reliability for a given network to counting the number of satisfying assignments of a Σ11 formula, which is amenable to recent hashing-based techniques developed for counting satisfying assignments of SAT formula. We then apply RelNet to ten real world power-transmission grids across different cities in the U.S. and are able to obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretically sound a priori estimates of reliability between several pairs of nodes of interest. Such estimates will help managing uncertainty and support rational decision making for community resilience.},

  abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

  abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm can naturally be applied to combinatorial search problems on graphs. The quantum circuit has p applications of a unitary operator that respects the locality of the graph. On a graph with bounded degree, with p small enough, measurements of distant qubits in the state output by the QAOA give uncorrelated results. We focus on finding big independent sets in random graphs with dn/2 edges keeping d fixed and n large. Using the Overlap Gap Property of almost optimal independent sets in random graphs, and the locality of the QAOA, we are able to show that if p is less than a d-dependent constant times log n, the QAOA cannot do better than finding an independent set of size .854 times the optimal for d large. Because the logarithm is slowly growing, even at one million qubits we can only show that the algorithm is blocked if p is in single digits. At higher p the algorithm "sees" the whole graph and we have no indication that performance is limited.},

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

The use of Monte Carlo sampling techniques in tensor network approaches significantly reduces the cost of tensor contractions, potentially leading to a substantial increase in computational efficiency. Previous proposals are based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme generated by locally updating configurations and, as such, must deal with equilibration and autocorrelation times, which result in a reduction of efficiency. Here we propose a perfect sampling scheme, with vanishing equilibration and autocorrelation times, for unitary tensor networks -- namely tensor networks based on efficiently contractible, unitary quantum circuits, such as unitary versions of the matrix product state (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN), and the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). Configurations are directly sampled according to their probabilities in the wavefunction, without resorting to a Markov chain process. We also describe a partial sampling scheme that can result in a dramatic (basis-dependent) reduction of sampling error.},

It is intended mainly for students that wish to learn complexity theory and for educators that intend to teach a course on complexity theory. The book is also intended to promote interest in complexity theory and make it acccessible to general readers with adequate background (which is mainly being comfortable with abstract discussions, definitions and proofs). We expect most readers to have a basic knowledge of algorithms, or at least be fairly comfortable with the notion of an algorithm.The book focuses on several sub-areas of complexity theory (including, e.g., pseudorandomness and probabilistic proof systems). In each case, the exposition starts from the intuitive questions addresses by the sub-area, as embodied in the concepts that it studies. The exposition discusses the fundamental importance of these questions, the choices made in the actual formulation of these questions and notions, the approaches that underly the answers, and the ideas that are embedded in these answers. Our view is that these (\textbackslash non-technical") aspects are the core of the field, and the presentation attempts to re ect this view.},

  abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling the implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of applications for which quantum computers have an established advantage. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.’s quantum approximate optimization algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost function based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the quantum alternating operator ansatz, is the consideration of general parameterized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach, in the spirit of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. In addition to introducing the quantum alternating operator ansatz, we lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide a compendium with brief descriptions of mappings for a diverse array of problems.},

We consider two general classes of annealing Hamiltonians: stoquastic ones, which can be simulated efficiently using the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, and nonstoquastic ones, which cannot be treated efficiently. We implement the latter by adding antiferromagnetically coupled two-spin driver terms to the traditionally studied transverse-field Ising model, and compare their performance to that of similar stoquastic Hamiltonians with ferromagnetically coupled additional terms. We focus on a model of long-range Ising spin glass as our problem Hamiltonian and carry out the comparison between the annealers by numerically calculating their success probabilities in solving random instances of the problem Hamiltonian in systems of up to 17 spins. We find that, for a small percentage of mostly harder instances, nonstoquastic Hamiltonians greatly outperform their stoquastic counterparts and their superiority persists as the system size grows. We conjecture that the observed improved performance is closely related to the frustrated nature of nonstoquastic Hamiltonians.},

Moreover, albeit targeting an NP-complete problem, SAT solvers are increasingly used for tackling problems beyond NP. Despite the success of SAT in practice, modeling with SAT and more importantly implementing SAT-based problem solving solutions is often a difficult and error-prone task. This paper proposes the PySAT toolkit, which enables fast Python-based prototyping using SAT oracles and SAT-related technology. PySAT provides a simple API for working with a few state-of-the-art SAT oracles and also integrates a number of cardinality constraint encodings, all aiming at simplifying the prototyping process. Experimental results presented in the paper show that PySAT-based implementations can be as efficient as those written in a low-level language.},

  abstract = {The class of problems involving the random generation of combinatorial structures from a uniform distribution is considered. Uniform generation problems are, in computational difficulty, intermediate between classical existence and counting problems. It is shown that exactly uniform generation of ‘efficiently verifiable’ combinatorial structures is reducible to approximate counting (and hence, is within the third level of the polynomial hierarchy). Natural combinatorial problems are presented which exhibit complexity gaps between their existence and generation, and between their generation and counting versions. It is further shown that for self-reducible problems, almost uniform generation and randomized approximate counting are inter-reducible, and hence, of similar complexity.},

  abstract = {Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.},

While obtaining the ground state of a spin-glass benchmark instance represents a difficult task, the gold standard for any optimization algorithm or machine is to sample all solutions that minimize the Hamiltonian with more or less equal probability. Our results show that while naive transverse-field quantum annealing on the D-Wave 2X device can find the ground-state energy of the problems, it is not well suited in identifying all degenerate ground-state configurations associated with a particular instance. Even worse, some states are exponentially suppressed, in agreement with previous studies on toy model problems [New J. Phys. 11, 073021 (2009)]. These results suggest that more complex driving Hamiltonians are needed in future quantum annealing machines to ensure a fair sampling of the ground-state manifold.},

One of the main reasons for these improvements has been the wide range of practical applications of SAT. Indeed, examples of modern applications of SAT range from termination analysis in term-rewrite systems to circuit-level prediction of crosstalk noise. The success of SAT solvers motivated many practical applications, but many practical applications have also provided the examples and the challenges that allowed the development of more efficient SAT solvers. This paper provides an overview of some of the most well-known applications of SAT and outlines several other successful applications of SAT. Moreover, the improvements in SAT solvers motivated the development of new algorithms for strategic extensions of SAT. As a result, the paper also provides a brief survey of recent work on extensions of SAT, including pseudo-Boolean constraints, maximum satisfiability, model counting and quantified Boolean formulas.},

An introduction of quantum transitions to all states with equal weights is shown to greatly improve the situation, but with a sacrifice in annealing time.

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

We describe our analytical studies of this type of Hamiltonians with infinite-range non-random as well as random interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the efficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing. It is shown that multi-body transverse interactions like {$<$}italic{$>$}XX{$<$}/italic{$>$} and {$<$}italic{$>$}XXXXX{$<$}/italic{$>$} with positive coefficients appended to a stoquastic transverse-field Ising model render the Hamiltonian non-stoquastic and reduce a first-order quantum phase transition in the simple transverse-field case to a second-order transition. This implies that the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a first-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore exponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a polynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time). The examples presented here represent rare instances where strong quantum effects, in the sense that they cannot be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum Monte Carlo, have analytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing for combinatorial optimization problems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Many AI problems, when formalized, reduce to evaluating the probability that a propositional expression is true. In this paper we show that this problem is computationally intractable even in surprisingly restricted cases and even if we settle for an approximation to this probability. We consider various methods used in approximate reasoning such as computing degree of belief and Bayesian belief networks, as well as reasoning techniques such as constraint satisfaction and knowledge compilation, that use approximation to avoid computational difficulties, and reduce them to model-counting problems over a propositional domain. We prove that counting satisfying assignments of propositional languages is intractable even for Horn and monotone formulae, and even when the size of clauses and number of occurrences of the variables are extremely limited. This should be contrasted with the case of deductive reasoning, where Horn theories and theories with binary clauses are distinguished by the existence of linear time satisfiability algorithms. What is even more surprising is that, as we show, even approximating the number of satisfying assignments (i.e., “approximating” approximate reasoning), is intractable for most of these restricted theories. We also identify some restricted classes of propositional formulae for which efficient algorithms for counting satisfying assignments can be given.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade general satisfiability testing algorithms have proven to be surprisingly effective at solving a wide variety of constraint satisfaction problem, such as planning and scheduling (Kautz and Selman 2003). Solving such NP-complete tasks by "compilation to SAT" has turned out to be an approach that is of both practical and theoretical interest. Recently, (Sang et al. 2004) have shown that state of the art SAT algorithms can be efficiently extended to the harder task of counting the number of models (satisfying assignments) of a formula, by employing a technique called component caching. This paper begins to investigate the question of whether "compilation to model-counting" could be a practical technique for solving real-world \#P-complete problems, in particular Bayesian inference. We describe an efficient translation from Bayesian networks to weighted model counting, extend the best model-counting algorithms to weighted model counting, develop an efficient method for computing all marginals in a single counting pass, and evaluate the approach on computationally challenging reasoning problems.},

I t is known that, when restricted to formulas having only two literals per clause, this problem has an efficient (polynomial-time) solution. But the same problem on formulas having three literals per clause is NP-complete, and hence probably does not have any efficient solution.In this paper, we consider an infinite class of satisfiability problems which contains these two particular problems as special cases, and show that every member of this class is either polynomial-time decidable or NP-complete. The infinite collection of new NP-complete problems so obtained may prove very useful in finding other new NP-complete problems. The classification of the polynomial-time decidable cases yields new problems that are complete in polynomial time and in nondeterministic log space.We also consider an analogous class of problems, involving quantified formulas, which has the property that every member is either polynomial time decidable or complete in polynomial space.},

General application strategies and limitations of the approach are also discussed.GSAT is best viewed as a model-finding procedure.

Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis.{$<>$}},

Instead of “singleton sampling” the algorithm is allowed to sample a large set S ample; U in one step; the information returned from the sample is whether S contains any element having the property being counted.We attempt to classify the complexity of computing approximate solutions to problems in \#P. The classification is done in terms of the polynomial-time hierarchy (for short, P-hierarchy) [21].We give a relativization result that complements a recent result of Sipser and Gaacute;c [19] that BPP is contained in the second level of the P-hierarchy.},

While quantum algorithms such as adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) and quantum approximate optimization (QAOA) can minimize Hamiltonians, they are inadequate for counting ground states. We modify AQO and QAOA to count the ground states of arbitrary classical spin Hamiltonians, including counting ground states with arbitrary nonnegative weights attached to them. As a concrete example, we show how our method can be used to count the weighted fraction of edge covers on graphs, with user-specified confidence on the relative error of the weighted count, in the asymptotic limit of large graphs. We find the asymptotic computational time complexity of our algorithms, via analytical predictions for AQO and numerical calculations for QAOA, and compare with the classical optimal Monte Carlo algorithm (OMCS), as well as a modified Grover's algorithm. We show that for large problem instances with small weights on the ground states, AQO does not have a quantum speedup over OMCS for a fixed error and confidence, but QAOA has a sub-quadratic speedup on a broad class of numerically simulated problems. Our work is an important step in approaching general ground-state counting problems beyond those that can be solved with Grover's algorithm. It offers algorithms that can employ noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for solving ground state counting problems on small instances, which can help in identifying more problem classes with quantum speedups.},

They naturally arise for complex disordered systems in physics and chemistry, in mathematical graph theory, and in computer science. Counting problems, however, are among the hardest problems to access computationally. Here, we suggest a novel method to access a benchmark counting problem, finding chromatic polynomials of graphs. We develop a vertex-oriented symbolic pattern matching algorithm that exploits the equivalence between the chromatic polynomial and the zero-temperature partition function of the Potts antiferromagnet on the same graph. Implementing this bottom-up algorithm using appropriate computer algebra, the new method outperforms standard top-down methods by several orders of magnitude, already for moderately sized graphs. As a first application, we compute chromatic polynomials of samples of the simple cubic lattice, for the first time computationally accessing three-dimensional lattices of physical relevance. The method offers straightforward generalizations to several other counting problems.},

  abstract = {The quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) represents a branch of quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems. A specific variant, the Grover-mixer (GM) QAOA, ensures uniform amplitude across states that share equivalent objective values. This property makes the algorithm independent of the problem structure, focusing instead on the distribution of objective values within the problem. In this work we provide an alternative proof for the upper bound on the probability of measuring a computational basis state from a GM QAOA circuit with a given depth, which is a critical factor in QAOA cost. Using this, we derive the upper bounds for the probability of sampling an optimal solution and for the approximation ratio of maximum optimization problems, both dependent on the objective value distribution. Through numerical analysis, we link the distribution to the problem size and build the regression models that relate the problem size, QAOA depth, and performance upper bound. Our results suggest that the GM QAOA provides a quadratic enhancement in sampling probability and requires circuit depth that scales exponentially with problem size to maintain consistent performance.},

  abstract = {Optimization is fundamental in many areas of science, from computer science and information theory to engineering and statistical physics, as well as to biology or social sciences. It typically involves a large number of variables and a cost function depending on these variables. Optimization problems in the NP-complete class are particularly difficult, it is believed that the number of operations required to minimize the cost function is in the most difficult cases exponential in the system size. However, even in an NP-complete problem the practically arising instances might, in fact, be easy to solve. The principal question we address in this thesis is: How to recognize if an NP-complete constraint satisfaction problem is typically hard and what are the main reasons for this? We adopt approaches from the statistical physics of disordered systems, in particular the cavity method developed originally to describe glassy systems. We describe new properties of the space of solutions in two of the most studied constraint satisfaction problems - random satisfiability and random graph coloring. We suggest a relation between the existence of the so-called frozen variables and the algorithmic hardness of a problem. Based on these insights, we introduce a new class of problems which we named "locked" constraint satisfaction, where the statistical description is easily solvable, but from the algorithmic point of view they are even more challenging than the canonical satisfiability.},
